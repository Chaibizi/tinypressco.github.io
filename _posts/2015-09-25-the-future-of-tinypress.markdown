## Mission & Vision
Our <strong>vision</strong> is to be the world's most innovative open source writing company.

## Areas of Focus
TinyPress could be a lot of things for a lot of people, but it will only be the right thing if it is focused.

- Theme & blog creation product (web)
- Writing product (web, iOS, android apps)
- Inspiration product (web) _(more on this coming soon!)_
