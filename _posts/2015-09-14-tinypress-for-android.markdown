In case you missed it, Tinypress is now [available for android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.tinypress.android). The android version works just as the web version. You can create, edit and manage posts from your mobile device. The only missing feature for now is creating a Github page if you don't have one (as available on the [web app](https://tinypress.co/)).

So give it a shot. Download ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.tinypress.android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.tinypress.android)) and be sure to send your comments/feedback to love@tinypress.co or [@tinypress](https://twitter.com/tinypress).
